A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse\.\.\.\.
The spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> shall rest on him\.\.\.\.

# Isaiah 10:33--34

# David and his house are utterly dependent on God for their existence and success.

# Despite past failure, David's house is God's chosen instrument for the restoration of Israel.

# How do we see David in the Psalms?
# What is the nature of that association?

# Some statements on the Psalms and their early Jewish context:

## 1. We have *psalms*, not *the Book of Psalms* until the late first century.
## 2. Psalmic superscriptions are *paratextual* and are not product of the psalm's composition.
## 3. Nevertheless, the canonical shape of the Psalter, *paratexts and all*, is a key part of how we read the full 150 psalm collection as Christian scripture.

<!--
* We don't see anything approaching the 150 psalm collection of the Masoretic tradition until after the first century.
  * Mroczek: "[Insights from Qumran] contributed to the history of the development of the Hebrew Psalter, which scholars now imagine happened gradually, perhaps in two distinct stages—the order and text of Pss 1–89 became stabilized first, with the latter half of the Psalter still in flux, and circulating in diverse versions as of the first century CE."
  * This doesn't mean that the Psalms are the site of a canonical free-for-all prior to the first century, since psalmic texts from Qumran are essentially in agreement with the psalms of the MT at the level of individual psalms.
    * However, it does mean that the shape of psalm collections vary and are purpose-driven, i.e., we find smaller collections of psalms that are placed together for devotional, liturgical, or other purposes.
    * Further, when we think about "the Psalms" in terms of what apostolic or early Christian authors might have had access to, we must deal with the fact that their "Psalms" were not canonically identical to the psalms of the MT.
      * This doesn't mean that they were reading wildly different texts to our canonical psalms, but it does mean that the way the Psalms functioned as a collection was different and likely resembled examples of psalm collections elsewhere in early Jewish manuscript evidence.
  * An analogy: If I have a collection of vinyl records by a certain band, that's not necessarily a fixed collection. But if I have a "best of" box set, that's a fixed collection with a specific canonical shape and status. It might all be the same music, but the way it's conceived of and the way it's presented is different.

# Davidic association:
# <heb>לדוד</heb>
# τῷ Δαυιδ

<!--
* Davidic association in the Psalms is constituted almost entirely by Davidic superscriptions.
* David is almost never mentioned in the text of the psalms themselves, Psalm 18 being a notable exception.
* 73 psalms in the 150 psalm Masoretic Psalter have לדוד headings.
* These headings are commonly translated as "Of David" or "A Psalm of David."
  * The sense of the lamed is not unambiguously possessive in an authorial way.
  * This is suggested by the similarly ambiguous use of the dative in the Greek translation.
    * The sense is association, reference, or dedication, certainly; but not necessarily simple authorship.
    * Weirdly, the same lamed preposition is used for the expression "to the leader," but that is always translated as a dedication or liturgical instruction, rather than a possessive authorial attribution.

# Psalm 20: A Psalm... for David?
*To the leader.*\
*A Psalm of David.*\
The <sc>Lord</sc> answer you in the day of trouble!\
The name of the God of Jacob protect you!\
May he send you help from the sanctuary,\
and give you support from Zion.\
May he remember all your offerings,\
and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices\.\.\.\.\
Now I know that the <sc>Lord</sc> will help his anointed;\
he will answer him from his holy heaven\
with mighty victories by his right hand\.\.\.\.\
Give victory to the king, O <sc>Lord</sc>;\
answer us when we call.

# Psalm 51
*To the leader.*\
*A Psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.*\
Have mercy on me, O God,\
according to your steadfast love;\
    according to your abundant mercy\
    blot out my transgressions.\
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,\
    and cleanse me from my sin\.\.\.\.

<!--
* Several Davidic headings feature expanded references to David's biography.
* The point of the Davidic association here is to provide interpretive context for the reader/performer.
* This particular event from David's life isn't necessarily the occasion for the psalm's composition, but rather a narrative backdrop for the words of the psalm.
  * Indeed, this is essentially how the psalm is used in our liturgical context.
  * Whether or not David actually composed this psalm is not the concern of the superscription.
  * David's voice is the one that we are to imagine speaking these words.
  * Most of the psalms that are connected with David's biography are related to David as a sufferer or penitent. Episodes from his conflict with Saul or Absalom are featured. David's voice is expanded by these biographical headings.

# Psalm 96 (95 LXX)
*Ὅτε ὁ οἶκος ᾠκοδομεῖτο μετὰ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν, ᾠδὴ τῷ Δαυιδ.*\
*When the house was constructed after the captivity, a song of David.*\
\[No superscription in Hebrew\]

O sing to the <sc>Lord</sc> a new song;\
sing to the <sc>Lord</sc>, all the earth.\
Sing to the <sc>Lord</sc>, bless his name;\
tell of his salvation from day to day.\
Declare his glory among the nations,\
his marvelous works among all the peoples.\
For great is the <sc>Lord</sc>, and greatly to be praised;\
he is to be revered above all gods.\
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,\
but the <sc>Lord</sc> made the heavens\.\.\.\.

# Davidic association in the Psalms situates David as a character and animating persona, not necessarily an author or composer.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun, and learned,\
and discerning, and perfect in all his paths before God and men. And\
YHWH gave him a discerning and enlightened spirit. And he wrote psalms:\
three thousand six hundred; and songs to be sung before the altar over the perpetual\
offering of every day, for all the days of the year: three hundred\
and sixty-four; and for the sabbath offerings: fifty-two songs\.\.\.\.\
All these he spoke through the spirit of prophecy which had been given to him from before the Most High.

<!--
* Notably, when David is finally spoken of as composing psalms in the first century, the context is always biography, not bibliography, i.e., the description of David as a psalmist contributes to a description of David's life and deeds, not a description of psalmic origins.

# Acts 2:29--32
“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.
Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He was not abandoned to Hades,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did his flesh experience corruption.’\
This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.

# Acts 4:24--25
When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them, it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why did the Gentiles rage,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples imagine vain things?’”

<!--
* These texts go beyond Josephus or 11Q5 in their direct attribution of psalms to David.

# *Midr. Teh.* 1:2
The foremost among Prophets—he is Moses... the foremost among kings—he is David\.\.\.\.
***You find that whatever Moses did, David did.***
As Moses led Israel out of Egypt, so David led Israel out of servitude to Goliath\.\.\.\.
As Moses became king in Israel and in Judah, ... so David became king in Israel and in Judah\.\.\.\.
As Moses built an altar, so David built an altar.
As the one brought offerings, so the other brought offerings.
As Moses gave five books of laws to Israel, so David gave five Books of Psalms to Israel.

<!--
* It isn't until the rabbinic period that David is explicitly presented as the author of a canonical collection of psalms.

# David's voice in the Psalms is expanded from character and pious exemplar to composer and prophetic authority.

# In what way are the Psalms Davidic?

<!--
* The Psalms are associated with David, but in what way?
  * Through the superscriptions, many psalms are directly associated with David's life.
    * The character of David brings the psalms to life and provides a narrative context for their performance.
  * As prophetic traditions about David develop, David gains a new role as a prophetic composer.
    * As we see at Qumran and in Josephus, some of these connections don't directly incorporate David's authorship of a canonical collection of psalms.
    * What we see in Acts, where David is cited as the prophetic author of specific psalms, is a development of this tradition.
  * David's status as a character in the Psalms and his status as a prophetic figure work in tandem such that David's voice prophesies concerning Israel's future and concerning the future of the Davidic house.
